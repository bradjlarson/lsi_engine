README for Predictive Project

This is a set of functions that sits on top of the Gensim open source library. 

It requires Gensim, which in turn requires NumPy, SciPy, and the BLAS libraries. If on Ubuntu, it is recommended to get these libraries vis apt-get python-numpy python-scipy.

Functions are intended to make creating and deploying a model as simple as feeding it a query and a database connection. It also allows for easy querying against those models using queries from a database.
